## CCDS

![](http://www.ccds.iitkgp.ac.in/images/home.jpg)

High-Performance Computation based R&D in India is going to witness a new phase with the setting up of India's first state-of-the-art 1.3 PetaFlop High-Performance Computing facility and datacenter ecosystem at IIT Kharagpur under the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM). 

More details about CCDS can be found [here](http://www.ccds.iitkgp.ac.in/).

## PARAM Shakti
![](http://www.ccds.iitkgp.ac.in/images/image-01.jpg)

The supercomputer PARAM Shakti is based on a heterogeneous and hybrid configuration of Intel Xeon Skylake processors, and NVIDIA Tesla V100. The system was designed and implemented by HPC Technologies team, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). It consists of 2 Master nodes, 8 Login nodes, 10 Service/Management nodes and 442 (CPU+GPU) nodes with total peak computing capacity of 1.66 (CPU+GPU) PFLOPS performance. PARAM Shakti systems are based on Intel Xeon SKL G-6148, NVIDIA Tesla V100 with total peak performance of 1.6 PFLOPS. The cluster consists of compute nodes connected with Mellanox (EDR) infiniBand interconnect network. The system uses the Lustre parallel file system.
