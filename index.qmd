## High Performance Computing
<!-- Explaining the concept of High Performance Computing (HPC) and its importance in the modern world.  -->
High Performance Computing (HPC) integrates systems administration (including network and security knowledge) and parallel programming into a multidisciplinary field that combines digital electronics, computer architecture, system software, programming languages, algorithms and computational techniques.

HPC is important for several reasons including:

        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">
            <b>Speed:</b> HPC systems can perform complex calculations much faster than traditional computers.
        </span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">
            <b>Scale:</b> HPC systems can handle large amounts of data and complex simulations that would be impossible on traditional computers.
        </span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">
            <b>Scientific Discovery:</b> HPC is critical for many scientific disciplines, including climate modeling, molecular dynamics, computational fluid dynamics and genomic sequencing.
        </span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: bold;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">
            <b>Industrial Innovation:</b> HPC is used in many industries to improve product design, optimize manufacturing processes, and develop new materials.
        </span></p>

</ol>

## PARAM Shakti
<!-- Introducing Param Shakti and its importance in the context of HPC. -->
PARAM Shakti is a supercomputer located at IIT Kharagpur. It is based on a heterogeneous and hybrid configuration of Intel Xeon Skylake processors, and NVIDIA Tesla V100.

The system was designed and implemented by HPC Technologies team, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), under the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM). More details about PARAM Shakti can be found [here](http://www.hpc.iitkgp.ac.in/HPCF/paramShakti).

Students at IIT Kharagpur can access PARAM Shakti and utilize its computational power for research and academic purposes. Further information about how to access PARAM Shakti can be found [here](/gettingStarted.qmd).
