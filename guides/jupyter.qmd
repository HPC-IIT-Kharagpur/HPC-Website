This guide will help you set up and run a Jupyter Notebook on a GPU cluster.

## Prerequisites 

1. Make sure you have `jupyter` installed in your environment.
2. Install all the required packages beforehand. There is no internet access on the GPU cluster.

## Steps

### 1. Submit an Interactive GPU Job

Open a terminal and submit an interactive bash job to the GPU cluster:

```bash
srun -p gpu --time=HH:MM:SS --gres=gpu:N --pty bash
```

Replace:

- `HH:MM:SS` with your desired job duration (e.g., 04:00:00 for 4 hours)
- `N` with the number of GPUs you need (e.g., 1 or 2). You need to be privileged user to request more than 1 GPU.

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Once you're in the interactive shell:

1. Activate your Python environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate your_environment_name
   ```

2. (Optional) Use `screen` for session persistence:
   ```bash
   screen -S jupyter_session
   ```
   This allows you to detach and reattach to your session. Press `Ctrl+A` then `D` to detach, and use `screen -r jupyter_session` to reattach.
   
   See [this guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) for more information.

### 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

1. Get the GPU node's IP address:
   ```bash
   hostname -i
   ```
   Note down this IP address.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook --port 8888 --no-browser
   ```
   You can change the port number if needed.

3. Copy one of the full links provided in the output, which looks like:
   ```
   http://localhost:8888/tree?token=abcdef1234567890
   ```

### 4. Set Up SSH Tunnel

On your local machine:

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Create an SSH tunnel with the following command:
   ```bash
   ssh -t -t username@paramshakti.iitkgp.ac.in -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 ssh username@gpu_node_ip -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888
   ```
   Replace:
   - `username` with your actual username
   - `gpu_node_ip` with the IP address you noted in step 3.1
   - `8888` with the actual port number if you used a different one

### 5. Access Jupyter Notebook

1. Open a web browser on your local machine.
2. Paste the Jupyter Notebook URL you copied in step 3.3.
3. You should now see the Jupyter Notebook interface running on the GPU cluster.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter port conflicts, try using a different port number in steps 3.2 and 4.2.
- Make sure your local firewall isn't blocking the chosen port.
- If you're having trouble with the SSH tunnel, check that you have the necessary permissions and that your SSH key is set up correctly.

Remember to save your work regularly and close the Jupyter Notebook properly when you're done to free up GPU resources for others.
